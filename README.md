#### Lack of customization
Customization can vary from minor adjustments, such as altering the video style, to major overhauls, like modifying the entire UI. Many companies adhere to strict brand guidelines, making it impossible to implement custom brand templates and guidelines within existing solutions. Features such as adding a GitHub link, a repository link, or a custom domain are often unachievable with these solutions.

#### Rigid components
Existing solutions are often built on inflexible components, imposing significant limitations on customization. Integrating alternative authentication methods, such as OAuth from providers like GitHub or DevZero, becomes challenging. Additionally, incorporating various CMS options, essential for tasks like email distribution in virtual events, proves difficult. While some solutions offer integrations with platforms like Salesforce, others may require alternatives like Freshworks CRM, which are not readily available.

#### Pricing
The initial pricing tiers of many existing solutions are prohibitively high, particularly for scaling to accommodate thousands of viewers. As the audience grows, the cost escalates significantly, making it financially burdensome for businesses.
