2. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/): Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative.
Start your project with a Postgres database, Authentication, instant APIs, Edge Functions, Realtime subscriptions, Storage, and Vector embeddings.
Our application utilizes Redis for caching frequently accessed data, optimizing performance. Additionally, Supabase serves as the primary database for storing and managing event-related information securely.

- **Backend**<br>
  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): Next.js enables you to create high-quality web applications with the power of React components.It is the React framework for the web.
